  abstract = {With the increasing proliferation of malicious code, the camouflage of malicious code is more difficult to cope with. Traditional malicious code detection techniques based on byte comparison have limited accuracy. Detection techniques based on traditional machine learning are highly dependent on feature selection, and the quality of the classifier directly affects the detection results; this increases the difficulty of accurately distinguishing the types of malicious code. To address these problems, a deep neural network-based malicious code detection method is proposed in this work. First, the code binary file is transformed into a corresponding gray-scale image, and then the enhanced RGBA image is formed by using an image enhancement scheme based on information entropy and code file structure. Afterwards, a convolutional neural network is used. The network extracts high-dimensional features of the enhanced code image, detects the malicious code, and classifies the malicious code. The experimental results show that the proposed method distinguishes malicious code with 98.83\% detection accuracy. Its classification accuracy is 97.74\% (with positive samples) and 98.85\% (without positive samples). These high levels of accuracy are suitable for current complex and changeable malicious code environments, and can provide a new solution for the current malicious code detection field.},

  abstract = {We propose a simple yet effective method for visualizing and classifying malware using image processing techniques. Malware binaries are visualized as gray-scale images, with the observation that for many malware families, the images belonging to the same family appear very similar in layout and texture. Motivated by this visual similarity, a classification method using standard image features is proposed. Neither disassembly nor code execution is required for classification. Preliminary experimental results are quite promising with 98\% classification accuracy on a malware database of 9,458 samples with 25 different malware families. Our technique also exhibits interesting resilience to popular obfuscation techniques such as section encryption.},
